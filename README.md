# Cecilia's Homepage

This is a standard personal website with a sticky nav and consistent hero banner throughout the site. The main home page features an interactive button that cycles through descriptors of the author.

## Author
This webpage was designed and built from scratch by Cecilia Lopez, except for some Instagram embed code. I also created the website background image in Photoshop.

## Class Link
This is a first project for a web development class taught by John Guerra Gomez at Northeastern University. URL here: https://johnguerra.co/classes/webDevelopment_fall_2022/

## Project Objective
The purpose of this project was to familiarize ourselves with CSS, HTML, Bootstrap, and JavaScript by building a personal webpage with information about ourselves.

## Visuals

## Instructions
Download the repo and replace text and images with your own. Note that header images must be 200x200 pixels, and the background image is 1920x1080 pixels. Replace colors and descriptors from the "innovator" button on the homepage in script.js and make sure to adjust logic for accessibility (background color and text color contrast).
